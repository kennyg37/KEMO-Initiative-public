The kemo initiative application has a website as its frontend
At the moment the website uses backed apis from my previous projects 
And are deployed in the github repository https://github.com/kennyg37/My-BRAND-Ken-Ganza
the backend apis are deployed on render


SETUP: Kemo has no setup you just need to access the app at  https://kemo-initiative.vercel.app/


Thank you !!!!
